### Compile the binary and run it

```sh
./login
```

#### Result

```sh
Enter admin password: 
hello
Incorrect Password!
Failed to log in as Admin (authorised=0) :(
```

We didn't log in so let's take a look at the source code using ghidra

### Ghidra

We see that there is a variable that takes in 6 characters which is supposed to be our password and also that the actual thing they want as password is the string `pass` but now let's try to overwrite the authorized variable so we don't need the password

By looking at the stack in ghidra we can tell that with 7 characters we will be able to get authorized

Let's put together a script to do this automatically
