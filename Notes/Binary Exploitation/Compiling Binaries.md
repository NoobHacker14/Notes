[[All the stuff we need to Install]]

### 32 Bit with no protections

```sh
gcc <file_name>.c -o <binary_name> -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie -m32
```


> [!note] **Note**
> If you want 64 bit don't mention the `-m32` argument 
> If you want any of the protections just don't mention it when compiling

### Install libraries

```sh
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
```

> [!warning] **Warning**
> Must install the 32 bit libraries for gcc if trying to compile it in 32 bit
